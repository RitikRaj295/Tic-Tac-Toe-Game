# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

<h4>This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns selecting boxes, with Player 1 represented by "0" and Player 2 represented by "X". The game automatically checks for a winner based on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe rules, such as matching rows, columns, or diagonals.</h4>

Features
9 interactive boxes arranged in a 3x3 grid.
Two players can play alternately.
Player 1 selects a box and the inner text becomes "0".
Player 2 selects a box and the inner text becomes "X".
The game continues alternately until a player wins or the grid is full.
How to Play
The game starts with Player 1's turn (Player 1 is "0").
Click on any empty box in the 3x3 grid.
If it's Player 1's turn, the box's text will become "0".
If it's Player 2's turn, the box's text will become "X".
The game will automatically check after each turn if there is a winner.
A player wins if they get three of their marks (either "0" or "X") in:
A row (horizontal line)
A column (vertical line)
A diagonal line
If all boxes are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
Rules
Players take turns marking a box in the grid.
Player 1 always starts first with the mark "0".
Player 2 marks the box with "X".
A player wins by placing three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
The game ends either with a win or a draw (when all boxes are filled with no winner).
