# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns selecting boxes, with Player 1 represented by "0" and Player 2 represented by "X". The game automatically checks for a winner based on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe rules, such as matching rows, columns, or diagonals.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ol>
<li>9 interactive boxes arranged in a 3x3 grid.</li>
<li>Two players can play alternately.</li>
<li>Player 1 selects a box and the inner text becomes "0".</li>
<li>Player 2 selects a box and the inner text becomes "X".</li>
<li>The game continues alternately until a player wins or the grid is full.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to Play</h2>
<ol>
The game starts with Player 1's turn (Player 1 is "0").
<li>Click on any empty box in the 3x3 grid.</li>
<li>If it's Player 1's turn, the box's text will become "0".</li>
<li>If it's Player 2's turn, the box's text will become "X".</li>
<li>The game will automatically check after each turn if there is a winner.</li>
<li>A player wins if they get three of their marks (either "0" or "X") in:</li>
<li>A row (horizontal line)</li>
<li>A column (vertical line)</li>
<li>A diagonal line</li>
<li>If all boxes are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.</li>
</ol>
